Instructions for Running the Face Recognition Program by Mike Iannotti:

1. Begin by installing Python, OpenCV, and NumPy on your system.
2. Organize folders containing JPEG images for each individual you want to recognize within the "train" folder. Having more images generally leads to better results.
3. Replace the placeholder arrays in the provided files with the names of the individuals you're adding.
4. Execute the "list_cameras" script to identify the appropriate camera index for your device.
5. Run the "faces_train" script to train the face recognizer model using the images you've added.
6. Finally, run the "face_recognition" program to initiate the face recognition process.
