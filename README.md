Facial recognition program in Python with the OpenCV computer vision library.

This program takes a set of folders of training data of different people and uses them to train the model and decide which people are currently on the webcam.

This uses an OpenCV pretrained front-face model.

To run:
install python, opencv, and Numpy.
add folders of training data and replace the arrays in the files with the names of the folders.
